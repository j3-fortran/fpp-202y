                  ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5-N2234


             WORK ITEMS FROM THE HYBRID WG5 MEETING
         HELD ON JUNE 27 TO 28, 2024 IN BERKELEY, CA, USA


This is the work item list for the next revision of ISO/IEC 1539:2023
Fortran, referred to as Fortran 202Y, as adopted by WG5 at its 2024 
meeting in Berkeley, California, USA. It incorporates items (through US17)
previously adopted as set out in N2222.

This list is subject to amendment by WG5. References are to ISO WG5
N-documents or INCITS/Fortran papers (yy-nnn), but please understand that
this work item list is for general concepts and that development of the
features will be done by INCITS/Fortran, and may or may not closely resemble
detailed descriptions in the referenced papers.
